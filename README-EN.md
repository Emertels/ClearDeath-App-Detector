## Files

clear_death_app_detector.py, ClearDeath-App-Detector.ps1, and Session-Header.ps1 (required by the PowerShell version)

## Usage

1. Download or clone the complete repository.
2. Choose one version: `clear_death_app_detector.py` (Python) or `ClearDeath-App-Detector.ps1` (PowerShell). Run your preferred version and approve the UAC prompt when requested.

## Requirements

Windows 10 or Windows 11; Python 3.7+ for the Python version or Windows PowerShell 5.1 for the PowerShell version. Removal requires administrator privileges for selected entries.

## Review and options

A suspicious entry should be reviewed; it does not automatically mean the application is unwanted.

- **1 — Show hidden entries:** displays items hidden during this session again.
- **2 — View suspicious entries:** lists records that need review.
- **3 — Select for removal:** enter comma-separated numbers or `ALL`, review the selection, and type the confirmation phrase shown.
- **4 — Remove all:** selects the found entries and still requires confirmation.
- **5 — Exit.**

Before removal, the tool exports a Registry backup to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Emertels\ClearDeath\Backups`. It removes the uninstall key, not application files. The PowerShell version requires `Session-Header.ps1`; a Python version is also included.
